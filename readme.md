## About The Project

Reservation application.
----

- Create your team, add spaces, meeting rooms or whatever you want and let people book the slots.

- Configure your slots: duration, frequency, number of people per slot.

- Hide your profile or choose to have a profile. Public profiles allow you to be accessible by all users. For example, imagine yoga classes, a public profile would allow individuals to book classes even if you haven't added them to your team
